"""
This script will be responsible for interfacing with VCMI to export map data.
It will likely involve:
1. Preparing a Lua script for VCMI to execute.
2. Calling VCMI with the Lua script (method TBD - could be via command line if VCMI allows,
   or by placing the script in a VCMI mod's script directory and triggering it).
3. Retrieving the output (expected to be JSON) from the Lua script.
4. Saving the JSON data to the heroes3_planner/data/ directory.
